Ultrasonic Radar with Arduino

Detect any object that comes in the range of this radar with ultrasonic sensor and Arduino

Components Used:
1. Ultrasonic sensor
2. Servo motor
3. Arduino


In this project, I developed a functional and affordable radar-based object detection system using an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04), a 9g servo motor, and an Arduino Uno. By rotating the sensor across a 180Â° arc and calculating distances based on ultrasonic reflections, the system was able to detect obstacles within a defined range and visualize them in real time using Processing software. This setup successfully mimics the sweeping motion and detection principle of traditional radar systems, providing a simplified but highly illustrative model suitable for learning and demonstration purposes.
The system highlighted important concepts such as sensor interfacing, serial communication, distance measurement using time-of-flight principles, and real-time graphical simulation. It serves as a hands-on tool for understanding how radar principles can be applied using alternative waveforms like ultrasound. The ability to visualize scanning in a 2D radar interface makes it ideal for educational environments, hobbyists, and prototype demonstrations in robotics and automation projects. Additionally, this project offered an opportunity to explore the fundamentals of embedded system design, control algorithms, and data visualization.
Although the prototype has limitations in range, precision, and scanning speed, it opens a pathway for future improvements. With advanced sensors (e.g., mmWave radar), pan-tilt platforms for 3D scanning, and onboard data processing using Raspberry Pi or ESP32, the system can be scaled into more sophisticated applications like drone detection, autonomous navigation, or short-range surveillance. Overall, this project not only achieved its primary objectives but also laid the groundwork for exploring the intersection of sensing, computation, and interactive visualization in embedded systems
